# Message about the Study Repository
Our study focused on evaluating the impact of VO2max and body mass index (BMI) on the probability of improving the IPAQ score in patients who recovered from COVID-19. We utilized a robust repository of patient data, collecting detailed information on various physiological and behavioral variables.
In addition to the binomial logistic regression analysis that identified the significance of VO2max, we also applied correlation matrices and multiple linear regressions to explore additional relationships between the variables. These analyses allowed for a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between different factors influencing physical recovery after COVID-19 infection.

## Methodology
### Statistical Analyses:
#### Binomial Logistic Regression: 
We assessed the impact of VO2max and BMI on the probability of improving the IPAQ score.
#### Correlation Matrices: 
We explored the relationships between all collected variables to identify significant patterns and associations.
#### Multiple Linear Regressions: 
We investigated the combined influences of multiple variables on specific health outcomes, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the determinants of recovery.
