# Message about the Study Repository
In this study, we use a binomial logistic regression analysis that identified the significance of VO2max, we also applied correlation matrices and multiple linear regressions to explore additional relationships between the variables. These analyses allowed for a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between different factors influencing physical recovery after COVID-19 infection.

## Methodology
### Statistical Analyses:
#### Binomial Logistic Regression: 
We assessed the impact of VO2max and BMI on the probability of improving the IPAQ score.
#### Correlation Matrices: 
We explored the relationships between all collected variables to identify significant patterns and associations.
#### Multiple Linear Regressions: 
We investigated the combined influences of multiple variables on specific health outcomes, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the determinants of recovery.
